**Critical:** Complete Stage 1 (spec compliance) BEFORE Stage 2 (code quality). Never review code quality for functionality that doesn't meet the specification.

## Stage 1: Spec Compliance Review

### Core Directive

> "The implementer finished suspiciously quickly. Their report may be incomplete, inaccurate, or optimistic."

Approach every review with professional skepticism. Verify claims independently.

### The Three Verification Categories

#### Category 1: Missing Requirements

**Check for features that were requested but not implemented.**

| Question                          | How to Verify                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Did they skip requested features? | Compare PR to original requirements line by line |
| Are edge cases handled?           | Check error paths, empty states, boundaries      |
| Were error scenarios addressed?   | Look for try/catch, error boundaries, validation |
| Is the happy path complete?       | Trace through primary use case manually          |

````markdown
## Example Review Finding

**Missing Requirement:** Issue #42 requested "password must be at least 8 characters"

**Found in code:**

```typescript
// No length validation present
function validatePassword(password: string) {
  return password.length > 0 // Only checks non-empty
}
```
````

**Status:** ❌ Incomplete - minimum length validation missing

````

#### Category 2: Unnecessary Additions

**Check for scope creep and over-engineering.**

| Question | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Features beyond specification? | Compare to original requirements |
| Over-engineering? | Is complexity justified by requirements? |
| Premature optimization? | Is performance cited without measurements? |
| Unrequested abstractions? | Are there helpers/utils for one-time use? |

```markdown
## Example Review Finding

**Unnecessary Addition:** Added caching layer not in requirements

**Found in code:**
```typescript
// Original requirement: "Fetch user by ID"
// Actual implementation:
class CachedUserRepository {  // Not requested
  private cache = new Map();
  private ttl = 60000;

  async getUser(id: string) {
    if (this.cache.has(id)) { ... }
    // 50 lines of cache logic
  }
}
````

**Status:** ⚠️ Scope creep - discuss before merging

````

#### Category 3: Interpretation Gaps

**Check for misunderstandings of requirements.**

| Question | How to Verify |
|----------|---------------|
| Different understanding of requirements? | Ask author to explain their interpretation |
| Unclarified assumptions? | Look for comments like "assuming..." |
| Ambiguous specs resolved incorrectly? | Compare to similar existing features |

```markdown
## Example Review Finding

**Interpretation Gap:** "Sort by date" implemented as ascending

**Requirement stated:** "Sort by date" (ambiguous)

**Author implemented:** Oldest first (ascending)

**Expected:** Most recent first is typical UX pattern

**Status:** ❓ Clarify - which sort order was intended?

## Why Order Matters

### Stage 1 Must Come First

| Scenario      | Waste from Wrong Order                                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Skip Stage 1  | Review 500 lines of code quality, then discover wrong feature was built |
| Stage 2 First | Suggest refactoring, then realize the code shouldn't exist              |
| Combined      | Mix concerns, miss systematic issues                                    |

### Separation of Concerns

- **Stage 1 (Spec):** Does it do the right thing?
- **Stage 2 (Quality):** Does it do the thing right?

Code quality review is meaningless if the code doesn't implement the correct functionality.

## Spec Compliance Checklist

### Before You Start

- [ ] Read the original issue/ticket completely
- [ ] Identify all explicit requirements
- [ ] Identify implicit requirements from context
- [ ] Note any acceptance criteria listed

### During Review

**Missing Requirements:**

- [ ] All required features present
- [ ] Edge cases covered (empty, null, max values)
- [ ] Error handling as specified
- [ ] Happy path fully functional
- [ ] UI matches mockups/specs if provided

**Unnecessary Additions:**

- [ ] No unrequested features
- [ ] No speculative abstractions
- [ ] No premature optimizations
- [ ] Scope matches requirements exactly

**Interpretation Gaps:**

- [ ] Author's understanding matches spec
- [ ] Ambiguities resolved correctly
- [ ] Assumptions are documented and valid
- [ ] Behavior matches similar existing features

### After Review

- [ ] Document all findings with file:line references
- [ ] Categorize as missing/unnecessary/interpretation
- [ ] Prioritize: blocking vs. non-blocking issues

## Output Format

### Compliant Result

```markdown
## Spec Compliance Review: ✅ PASS

All requirements verified:

- ✅ User can upload profile image (req #1)
- ✅ Image resized to 200x200 (req #2)
- ✅ Invalid formats rejected with error message (req #3)
- ✅ Progress indicator during upload (req #4)

**Proceed to:** Code Quality Review
```

### Issues Found

```markdown
## Spec Compliance Review: ❌ ISSUES FOUND

### Missing Requirements

1. **Progress indicator not implemented** (req #4)
   - File: `ProfileUpload.tsx`
   - Expected: Progress bar during upload
   - Found: No progress indication

2. **Error messages not user-friendly** (req #3)
   - File: `ProfileUpload.tsx:45`
   - Expected: "Please upload a JPG or PNG file"
   - Found: "Error: INVALID_FORMAT"

### Unnecessary Additions

1. **Image cropping feature not requested**
   - File: `ImageCropper.tsx` (new file, 150 lines)
   - Impact: Adds complexity, delays delivery
   - Recommendation: Remove or create separate PR

**Action Required:** Address missing requirements before code quality review
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake                                     | Why It's Wrong                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Reviewing code style before spec compliance | Wasted effort if wrong thing was built |
| Assuming spec was followed                  | Verify independently                   |
| Skipping edge cases                         | Bugs hide in boundaries                |
| Accepting "we can add it later"             | Technical debt accumulates             |
| Missing scope creep                         | Unreviewed code enters codebase        |
