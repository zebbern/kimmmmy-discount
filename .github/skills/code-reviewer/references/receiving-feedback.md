# Receiving Feedback

---

## Core Mindset

> "Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Technical correctness over social comfort."

Code review feedback is a technical discussion, not a social one. Focus on the code, not on feelings.

---

## The Six-Step Process

### Step 1: Read Completely

**Without reacting.** Read the entire comment before forming any response.

```markdown
❌ BAD: Read first sentence → start typing defense
✅ GOOD: Read entire comment → understand full context → then respond
```

### Step 2: Restate Requirements

Rephrase the reviewer's feedback in your own words to confirm understanding.

```markdown
Reviewer: "This function is doing too much. It handles validation,
transformation, and persistence all in one place."

Your restatement: "You're suggesting I split this into three separate
functions: validate(), transform(), and persist()?"
```

### Step 3: Check Against Codebase

Verify the feedback against actual code conditions before responding.

```typescript
// Reviewer says: "This will throw if user is null"

// Check the code:
function getUsername(user: User): string {
  return user.name // No null check - reviewer is correct
}

// Or discover context:
function getUsername(user: User): string {
  return user.name // TypeScript enforces User, null not possible
}
```

### Step 4: Evaluate Technical Soundness

Consider whether the feedback applies to your specific stack and context.

```markdown
Reviewer: "You should use useMemo here for performance"

Evaluate:

- Is this component re-rendering frequently? → Check React DevTools
- Is the computation expensive? → Profile it
- Does React 19's compiler auto-optimize this? → Check version
```

### Step 5: Respond with Substance

Provide technical acknowledgment or reasoned objection.

```markdown
✅ GOOD: "Fixed. Split into validate(), transform(), persist()
at lines 24, 45, 67."

✅ GOOD: "Respectfully disagree. This list has max 5 items
(see schema.ts:12), so filter performance is O(5)."

❌ BAD: "You're absolutely right! Great catch!"
❌ BAD: "I don't think that's necessary."
```

### Step 6: Implement One at a Time

Address each piece of feedback individually with verification.

```markdown
Feedback item 1: Add null check
→ Implement → Test → Commit → Verify → Move to next

Feedback item 2: Extract helper function
→ Implement → Test → Commit → Verify → Move to next

NOT: Try to address all feedback in one massive commit
```

## Avoiding Agreement Theater

### The Problem

Performative agreement wastes time and provides no information. When you write "Great point!" you're adding noise, not signal.

### Forbidden Phrases

| Phrase                      | Why It's Wrong                   |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| "You're absolutely right!"  | Sycophantic, adds no information |
| "Great point!"              | Empty praise, not a response     |
| "Excellent feedback!"       | Flattery, not engagement         |
| "Thanks for catching this!" | Unnecessary, just fix it         |
| "I really appreciate..."    | Social fluff, not technical      |

### Actions Demonstrate Understanding

```markdown
❌ "You're absolutely right! Great catch on that null check!
Thanks so much for pointing this out!"

✅ "Fixed. Added null check at line 42."
```

The code change shows you understood. Words are redundant.

### When Acknowledgment IS Appropriate

Brief, technical acknowledgment when learning something new:

```markdown
✅ "I wasn't aware of that edge case. Added handling at line 42."
✅ "Good point about thread safety. Added mutex at line 67."
```

## When to Push Back

### Valid Reasons to Disagree

Push back with technical reasoning when feedback:

| Situation                               | How to Respond                                                               |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Breaks existing functionality           | "This change would break Feature X (see test at tests/feature-x.spec.ts:34)" |
| Lacks full codebase context             | "This pattern exists because of Y (see architecture.md#constraints)"         |
| Violates YAGNI                          | "This flexibility isn't needed yet - only one caller exists"                 |
| Is technically incorrect                | "This actually works because of Z (link to docs)"                            |
| Conflicts with established architecture | "This conflicts with our JWT approach (see auth/README.md)"                  |

### Good Pushback Format

```markdown
## Template

This conflicts with [X]. [Evidence]. Was that the intent, or should we [alternative]?

## Example

This conflicts with our JWT authentication architecture (see auth/token.js:45).
Switching to sessions would require restructuring the API middleware.
Was that the intent, or should we keep JWT?
```

### Bad Pushback

```markdown
❌ "I don't think that's right."
❌ "That won't work."
❌ "We've always done it this way."
❌ "That's too much work."
```

## Verification Before Claiming Fixed

### The Checklist

Before writing "Fixed" or "Done":

- [ ] Change is implemented
- [ ] Tests pass (full suite, not just changed files)
- [ ] Specific behavior mentioned in feedback is verified
- [ ] Edge cases are tested
- [ ] No unintended side effects introduced

### Acceptable Responses

```markdown
✅ "Fixed. Added null check. Tests pass."
✅ "Fixed at line 42. Verified with test case X."
✅ "Implemented. All 47 tests pass."
```

### Unacceptable Responses

```markdown
❌ "I think this addresses your concern."
❌ "Should be fixed now."
❌ "Done, I believe."
❌ "Fixed (probably)."
```

### When You Can't Verify

If you cannot verify a fix:

```markdown
✅ "Implemented the change, but I'm unable to verify because
[specific reason]. Can you confirm on your end?"
```

## Quick Reference

| Situation                | Response                                            |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Reviewer is correct      | "Fixed. [What you changed]."                        |
| You need clarification   | "To confirm: you're suggesting [restatement]?"      |
| Reviewer is incorrect    | "This works because [evidence]. [Link to proof]."   |
| You disagree on approach | "This conflicts with [X]. Should we [alternative]?" |
| You learned something    | "I wasn't aware of [X]. Fixed at line [N]."         |
| You can't verify         | "Implemented. Unable to verify because [reason]."   |

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern              | Problem                         | Fix                                    |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Defensive responses  | Creates conflict, wastes time   | Assume good faith, respond technically |
| Apologetic responses | Unprofessional, adds noise      | Just fix it                            |
| Delayed responses    | Blocks review cycle             | Respond within hours, not days         |
| Vague responses      | Leaves reviewer uncertain       | Be specific about changes              |
| Ignoring feedback    | Disrespectful, creates friction | Address every point                    |
