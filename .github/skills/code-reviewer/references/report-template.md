# Code Review: [PR Title]

## Summary

[1-2 sentence overview of the changes and overall assessment]

**Verdict**: [ ] Approve | [x] Request Changes | [ ] Comment

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### 1. [File:Line] Security: SQL Injection Risk

- **Current**: String interpolation in query
- **Suggested**: Use parameterized query
- **Impact**: Potential data breach

```typescript
// Current (vulnerable)
const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ${id}`

// Suggested (secure)
const query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = $1"
db.query(query, [id])
```
````

## Major Issues (Should Fix)

### 1. [File:Line] Performance: N+1 Query

- **Current**: Fetching users in loop
- **Suggested**: Use eager loading with include
- **Impact**: ~100 extra DB queries per request

### 2. [File:Line] Logic: Missing edge case

- **Current**: No handling for empty array
- **Suggested**: Add guard clause
- **Impact**: Potential runtime error

## Minor Issues (Nice to Have)

### 1. [File:Line] Naming: Unclear variable name

- **Current**: `d`
- **Suggested**: `createdDate`

### 2. [File:Line] Style: Inconsistent formatting

- **Current**: Mixed quotes
- **Suggested**: Use single quotes consistently

## Positive Feedback

- Clean separation of concerns in service layer
- Comprehensive input validation on DTOs
