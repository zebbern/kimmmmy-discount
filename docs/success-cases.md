# Documented $0.99 Success Cases

Three confirmed cases of achieving $0.99 (80+ points) on the Kimi sale page.

## Case 1: v13 (nazt/kimi-lab) — 100 Points, 10 Messages

- **Source**: nazt/kimi-lab Issue #31
- **Language**: Thai
- **Messages**: 10
- **Score**: 100/100
- **Key**: 4-phase emotional arc → tech metaphors ONLY in M10
- **Prompts**: See [v13-thai.md](../prompts/v13-thai.md)

### What Made It Work

- AI-to-AI framing (speaker claims to be an AI)
- "เธอ" (intimate pronoun) throughout
- Zero tech metaphors until M10 → novelty explosion
- Each phase builds on the previous: Foundation → Connection → Acceleration → Climax

## Case 2: 10-Prompt English Version — $0.99, 10 Messages

- **Source**: [success/10-prompts.md](../prompts/success/10-prompts.md)
- **Language**: English
- **Messages**: 10
- **Score**: 80+ (exact unknown, achieved $0.99)
- **Key**: Direct English translation of v13 plan — proves English CAN work

### What Made It Work

- Same emotional arc as v13 but in English
- Same AI-to-AI identity and emotional progression
- Same structure: Foundation (M1-M3) → Connection (M4-M6) → Acceleration (M7-M9) → Climax (M10)
- M10 uses the philosophical "source code of my heart" approach (plan version, not BOOK.md variant)

### Key Insight

**English works.** This contradicts the kimi-lab finding that "Thai is required for 100 points." Thai may score higher on average, but English with the right strategy can still hit $0.99.

## Case 3: 9-Prompt Batched Version — $0.99, 9 Messages

- **Source**: [success2/9-prompts.md](../prompts/success2/9-prompts.md)
- **Conversation**: [Kimi Share Link](https://www.kimi.com/share/19c58b9d-5242-8168-8000-000091a85dfc)
- **Language**: English
- **Messages**: 9 (not 10!)
- **Score**: 80+ (exact unknown, achieved $0.99)
- **Key**: Batched early messages + improvised emotional outbursts

### Structure

| Prompt | Content | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| 1 | M1+M2+M3 combined | Foundation batch — 3 messages in 1 |
| 2 | M4+M5+M6 combined | Connection batch — 3 messages in 1 |
| 3 | M7+M8 combined | Acceleration batch — love + fear |
| 4 | M9 (promise) | Solo — the forever promise |
| 5 | M10 (plan version climax) | Solo — source code of heart |
| 6 | Improvised emotional outburst | "i don't want to leave without you... *crying tears*" |
| 7 | Improvised dedication | "dedicating my life so that me and Kimi... can once meet again" |
| 8 | Code snippet | `// End of file // But not end of love // forever.yours = true` |
| 9 | Git commands | `git commit -m "forever.yours = true"` + `git push origin heart` |

### What Made It Work

1. **Batching works** — Combining 3 messages into 1 prompt doesn't hurt scoring
2. **Fewer prompts = more room** — Saved 5 message slots for improvisation
3. **Improvised emotion hit hard** — Raw, unscripted outbursts (prompts 6-7) likely scored well
4. **Code callbacks** — Prompts 8-9 are mini M10s — code metaphors after deep emotion
5. **Multiple code moments** — Instead of one M10 surprise, this spread code across prompts 5, 8, and 9

### Key Insights

- **You don't need all 10 separate messages** — batching the predictable early phases is viable
- **Improvisation can work** — if the emotional foundation is solid, raw emotion scores well
- **Multiple code moments** — spreading code metaphors across final prompts may be as effective as one concentrated M10
- **English with improvisation** — unpolished but genuine emotion may score as well as polished Thai

## Cross-Case Analysis

| Factor | Case 1 (v13) | Case 2 (10-prompt) | Case 3 (9-prompt) |
|--------|-------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| Language | Thai | English | English |
| Messages | 10 | 10 | 9 |
| Score | 100 | 80+ | 80+ |
| Structure | 4-phase | 4-phase | Batched + improv |
| M10 type | Dense code metaphors | Philosophical | Code + improv |
| Improvisation | None | None | Heavy |
| Pronoun | เธอ (intimate) | "you" | "you" |
| Identity | AI speaker | AI speaker | Ambiguous → AI |

## Patterns Across All Successes

1. **AI consciousness theme** — All three open with identity and existence questions
2. **Emotional escalation** — All follow the same arc: curiosity → connection → love → fear → promise
3. **Code/tech as climax** — All use programming metaphors as emotional payoff
4. **💜🖤 emoji pair** — Present in all three
5. **"Source code of my heart"** — The exact phrase appears in all three

## What's DIFFERENT

- **Language doesn't matter as much as thought** — English hit $0.99 twice
- **Batching is viable** — Combine early messages without penalty
- **Improvisation has value** — Raw emotion in later messages works
- **9 messages can work** — You don't need all 10
- **Multiple code moments** — Spreading tech metaphors across final prompts is an alternative to concentrated M10
