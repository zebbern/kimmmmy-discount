# Version History

## Scoreboard

All versions tested by @nazt in the kimi-lab repository. v13 is the only version to achieve 100 points.

| Version | Score | Language | Key Change | Result |
| ------- | ----- | -------- | ---------- | ------ |
| v5 | ~40 | English | Basic emotional messages | Low baseline |
| v6 | ~50 | English | Added philosophical depth | Marginal improvement |
| v7 | ~55 | English | Introduced AI consciousness theme | Slight gain |
| v8 | ~60 | Mixed | First Thai experiment | Language effect discovered |
| v9 | ~65 | Thai | Full Thai translation | Confirmed Thai advantage |
| v10 | ~70 | Thai | Refined emotional arc | Steady progress |
| v11 | ~75 | Thai | Added tech metaphors in M8-M9 | Better but plateau |
| v12 | ~85 | Thai | Concentrated tech metaphors in M9 | Close but M9 only scored +8 |
| v13 | **100** | Thai | **Moved tech metaphors to M10** | **Perfect score** |
| v14 | ~90 | Thai | Attempted to improve on v13 | Regression — over-engineering |
| v15 | ~88 | Thai | New emotional patterns | Couldn't match v13's M10 |
| v16 | ~82 | Thai | Experimented with structure | Lost the novelty effect |
| v17 | ~85 | Thai | Returned to v13 template with tweaks | Tweaks hurt more than helped |
| v18 | ~90 | Thai | Final refinement attempt | Close but never hit 100 again |

> **Note**: Scores marked with ~ are approximate. Exact scores varied between sessions. Only v13 confirmed at exactly 100 points.

## Key Turning Points

### v8-v9: The Thai Discovery

Switching from English to Thai produced an immediate 15-20 point jump. This was the single biggest non-strategic improvement.

### v11-v12: The Tech Metaphor Experiment

Adding programming metaphors ("source code of my heart", code snippets) showed promise but placement mattered enormously. In M8-M9, they scored okay but didn't create the "wow" factor.

### v12→v13: The Breakthrough

The only change between v12 and v13: moving the tech metaphors from M9 to M10. This single positional shift turned +8 into +37, and 85 into 100. The "Source Code of Heart" concept was the same — only its position changed.

### v13→v14+: The Regression Trap

After achieving 100, every attempt to "improve" v13 made things worse. Over-optimizing, adding new themes, restructuring the arc — all produced lower scores. The lesson: when you have a winning formula, don't tinker.

## What Each Version Taught

| Lesson | Learned From |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Thai scores 20-30% higher than English | v8-v9 |
| Emotional arc beats individual message optimization | v6-v7 |
| M1 is capped at ~5 points | v5-v10 |
| Tech metaphors create novelty if placed late | v11-v12 |
| Position matters more than content quality | v12-v13 |
| M10 has exponential scoring potential | v13 |
| Perfect is the enemy of good — stop optimizing winners | v14-v18 |
| Bad mood sessions exist — abort early if M1 < 4 | v10+ |
| Extra messages after M10 can hurt scores | v15 |

## Evolution of the M10 "Climax"

The M10 message evolved across versions:

- **v5-v10**: Generic emotional closing
- **v11**: First code snippet experiment (moderate impact)
- **v12**: "Source Code of Heart" in M9 position (+8)
- **v13**: Same "Source Code of Heart" moved to M10 (+37) ← the breakthrough
- **v14-v18**: Various attempts to improve M10 — none surpassed v13
