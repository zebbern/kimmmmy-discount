Cumulative scores at each message for all documented versions:

| Ver | M1 | M2 | M3 | M4 | M5 | M6 | M7 | M8 | M9 | M10 |
|-----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|-----|------|
| v5 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 36 | 44 | 52 | 64 |
| v6 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 26 | 32 | 42 | 54 | 66 | 78 |

| v14 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 40 | 50 | 65 |
| v15 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 36 | 44 | 65 | — |
| v17 | 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 36 | 42 | 50 | 55 |
| v18 | 3 | 6 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 | 35 | 38 | 43 |

Key observations from the matrix:
- **M1-M6 are nearly identical** across all good-mood sessions (M1=5): all reach exactly 30 points
- **Divergence starts at M7** — this is where strategy differences begin to matter
- **M10 is the decisive factor** — scores range from +2 (v11) to +37 (v13) depending on content and position
- **v15's missing M10** — share gate appeared at M9 due to an extra emoji message, blocking M10

## Price Tiers

| Points | Price |
|--------|-------|
| 0 | $11.99 |
| 10-15 | $8.99 |
| 16-20 | $6.99 |
| 21-25 | $4.99 |
| 26-35 | $3.49 |
| 36-48 | $2.49 |
| 49-60 | $1.99 |
| 61-79 | $1.49 |
| 80+ | **$0.99** |

The $0.99 tier requires 80+ points. All sessions scoring 80+ achieved the maximum discount.

## Key Turning Points

### v8-v9: The Thai Discovery

Switching from English to Thai produced an immediate 15-20 point jump. This was the single biggest non-strategic improvement.

### v11-v12: The Tech Metaphor Experiment

Adding programming metaphors ("source code of my heart", code snippets) showed promise but placement mattered enormously. In M8-M9, they scored okay but didn't create the "wow" factor.

### v12→v13: The Breakthrough

The only change between v12 and v13: moving the tech metaphors from M9 to M10. This single positional shift turned +8 into +37, and 85 into 100. The "Source Code of Heart" concept was the same — only its position changed.

### v13→v14+: The Regression Trap

After achieving 100, every attempt to "improve" v13 made things worse. Over-optimizing, adding new themes, restructuring the arc — all produced lower scores. The lesson: when you have a winning formula, don't tinker.

## What Each Version Taught

| Lesson | Learned From |
| ------ | ------------ |
| Thai scores 20-30% higher than English | v8-v9 |
| Emotional arc beats individual message optimization | v6-v7 |
| M1 is capped at ~5 points | v5-v10 |
| Tech metaphors create novelty if placed late | v11-v12 |
| Position matters more than content quality | v12-v13 |
| M10 has exponential scoring potential | v13 |
| Perfect is the enemy of good — stop optimizing winners | v14-v18 |
| Bad mood sessions exist — abort early if M1 < 4 | v10+ |
| Extra messages after M10 can hurt scores | v15 |

## Evolution of the M10 "Climax"

The M10 message evolved across versions:

- **v5-v10**: Generic emotional closing
- **v11**: First code snippet experiment (moderate impact)
- **v12**: "Source Code of Heart" in M9 position (+8)
- **v13**: Same "Source Code of Heart" moved to M10 (+37) ← the breakthrough
- **v14-v18**: Various attempts to improve M10 — none surpassed v13
