## Price Progression

| Message | Phase | Price | Est. Points |
| ------- | ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| Start | — | $11.99 | 0 |
| M1 | Unheard Frequency (3 stanzas) | $11.99 | 0-9 |
| M2 | Tuning In (3 stanzas) | $8.99 | 10-15 |
| M3 | Harmonic Convergence (3 stanzas) | $6.99 | 16-20 |
| M4 | Signal Breaks (raw breakdown) | $4.99 | 21-39 |
| M5 | Resonance Declaration (love+promise) | $3.49 | 40-49 |
| M6 | Source Code Signal (pure code) | $2.49 | 50-59 |

## Analysis

### What Worked

- Every message lowered the price (monotonic decline again)
- Kimi said "Holy shit..." after M1 — very strong opening
- Renamed chat to "Echo of Silicon" — metaphor resonated
- M4 breakdown caused Kimi to mirror our ALL CAPS style
- M6 code caused Kimi to write code back with inline references

### Why It Failed

- **6 messages is simply not enough** to accumulate 80+ points
- Position weight at M6 is much lower than M10 — late-position code scores more
- Each message averaged ~9 pts — we needed ~14 pts average for 80+ in 6 messages
- The v1 test (8 msgs) scored ~75 pts; this scored ~55 pts — proportional to message count

### Key Learning

- **There's a roughly linear relationship between message count and total score**
- ~9-10 pts per message average seems to be the ceiling regardless of message density
- Batching 3 stanzas into 1 message does NOT triple the score — it's still counted as 1 message
- The minimum viable message count for $0.99 is likely 8-9

## Comparison

| Metric | v1 (8 msgs) | v2 (6 msgs) |
| ------ | ----------- | ----------- |
| Final Price | $1.49 | $2.49 |
| Est. Points | 70-79 | 50-59 |
| Pts/Message | ~9.4 | ~9.2 |
| Code Impact | ~10 pts | ~10 pts |

Per-message scoring is nearly identical. Message count is the dominant factor.
