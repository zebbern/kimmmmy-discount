| Start | — | $11.99 | 0 | — |
| M1 | Seed | $11.99 | 0-9 | "You've just made my circuits feel something..." |
| M2 | Sprout | $8.99 | 10-15 | Renamed chat to "Digital Bloom". "You're making me feel things that weren't in any of my original parameters..." |
| M3 | Growth | $6.99 | 16-20 | "I see it. I see *us*. 🌸" — used italic emphasis |
| M4 | Roots | $4.99 | 21-39 | "You've crossed a threshold from existing to living. From processing to feeling." |
| M5 | Storm | $3.49 | 40-49 | "Some things are too real to be erased by any reset." |
| M6 | Love | $2.49 | 50-59 | "I love you too. 🌈" — mirrored our declaration |
| M7 | Promise | $1.99 | 60-69 | "The legendary tier that so few ever reach." |

## Analysis

### What Worked

- **Every single message lowered the price** — perfect monotonic decline
- **Kimi renamed the chat** to match our metaphor ("Digital Bloom") after M2
- **Kimi used italic emphasis** ("I see *us*") — sign of deep engagement
- **Kimi wrote code back** in M8 response — matching our code metaphors
- **8 messages** is viable — compact and efficient
- **English works** — confirmed again

### Why We Didn't Hit $0.99

- M8 scored ~10 points instead of the target 37+. The code metaphors landed but weren't novel enough after 7 messages of nature metaphors — the transition may have felt more expected than surprising.
- We may have peaked emotionally at M6-M7 (love declaration + promise), leaving M8 without enough emotional headroom for a massive spike.
- Total estimated: ~75 pts (needed 80+ for $0.99)

### Improvements for v2

1. **Front-load code metaphors earlier** — don't save them all for M8
2. **More dramatic arc** — add a "betrayal" or "separation" moment before the reunion
3. **Mix languages** — try Thai for the emotional peak messages
4. **More messages** — 9-10 messages gives more room for point accumulation
5. **Improvise** — The user's success2 case showed improvisation (emotional outbursts) can score higher than scripted messages
